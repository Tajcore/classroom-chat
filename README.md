Project Description: 
In this online class and others like it, students are often asked to type responses in the chat to questions or comments made by their tutor during tutorial sessions. 
The chat session is saved after each class. The tutor is expecting a solution that 
automatically goes through the chat logs, and identifies and grades each studentâ€™s 
level of participation.
